This project is from the Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.
It is a command line implementation of the game "Connect Four", a two player game where game pieces are dropped into columns. Upon connecting four of a given players pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diaganol fashion, that player wins the game. 
The goal of this project was to practice TDD with Rspec.
